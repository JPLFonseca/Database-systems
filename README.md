## Project Description

The project is divided into two parts:

* **Part 1**: The objective was to consolidate knowledge on creating conceptual, logical, and physical models for relational databases and using Structured Query Language (**SQL**) to create the database.
* **Part 2**: The goal was to implement the requirements of a web application using **JavaServer Pages (JSP)** and **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)** to interface with the database.

The system manages a car rental business with multiple parking locations near airports and urban areas.

* **Client**: Can make reservations for vehicles by selecting the type, pickup location, and rental period.
* **Employee**: Can identify the driver of a car on a specific date and evaluate a driver.
* **Driver**: Can manage their profile and evaluate the rental service.
* **Manager**: Can view vehicle history, including maintenance and evaluations, and generate reports, such as the profit ranking by vehicle brand.
